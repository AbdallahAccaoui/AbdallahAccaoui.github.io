It can encrypt or decrypt individual files, using a password and can allow users to search for key words in encrypted files.\nIt uses:\n- a password-based key derivation function to generate a \"master\" key.\n- a simpler KDF scheme to generate a series of keys for further operations.\n- a two different PRFs to implement a four-round feistel cipher that are used for encryption and decryption.\n- an HMAC-SHA2-256 in order to detect attempts to tamper with files.\n- an HMAC-SHA2-256 in order to support encrypted search terms.","createdAt":"2022-08-25T15:15:05.045Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-25T15:15:09.391Z","publishedAt":"2022-08-25T15:15:09.389Z","githubLink":"https://github.com/AbdallahAccaoui/fencrypt","photos":{"data":[{"id":18,"attributes":{"name":"thumbnail-fencrypt.jpg","alternativeText":"thumbnail-fencrypt.jpg","caption":"thumbnail-fencrypt.jpg","width":1920,"height":2880,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_thumbnail-fencrypt.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","path":null,"width":104,"height":156,"size":4.13,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_thumbnail-fencrypt.jpg","hash":"large_thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","path":null,"width":667,"height":1000,"size":73.42,"url":"/uploads/large_thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_thumbnail-fencrypt.jpg","hash":"medium_thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","path":null,"width":500,"height":750,"size":46.48,"url":"/uploads/medium_thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_thumbnail-fencrypt.jpg","hash":"small_thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","path":null,"width":333,"height":500,"size":24.43,"url":"/uploads/small_thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d.jpg"}},"hash":"thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":405.73,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_fencrypt_f2d4a3947d.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-08-25T15:14:56.858Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-25T15:14:56.858Z"}}]},"projectTagLnk":{"data":[{"id":2,"attributes":{"tagName":"Python","createdAt":"2022-07-18T20:12:12.731Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-18T20:22:16.468Z","publishedAt":"2022-07-18T20:12:27.292Z","knowledgeLevel":"Intermediate","skillGrowth":"Increase"}}]}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
