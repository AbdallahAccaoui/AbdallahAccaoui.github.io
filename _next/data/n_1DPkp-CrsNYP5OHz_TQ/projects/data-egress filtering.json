They are well integrated with mobile apps and cloud microservices. To keep pace with business agility, businesses are adopting a representational state transfer (REST) architectural style for their APIs. However, REST APIs introduces security risks and challenges. For instance, in 2021, hackers exploited LinkedIn API’s access control to retrieve more than 90% of the total users’ information. Nevertheless, Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) selected top ten API vulnerabilities to avoid and mitigate when developing APIs.\nThis NodeJS service is a data egress filtering service which reduces the risk of exposing common sensitive information and allows organizations to label sensitive data.
